# 🧩 Project Overview

This Tableau project provides a comprehensive data-driven analysis of global bird strike incidents (2000–2013) to identify trends, assess safety risks, and recommend effective strategies to improve aviation safety and operational efficiency.

The analysis focuses on understanding when, where, and how bird strikes occur — and how airlines and airports can minimize financial, safety, and environmental impacts through data insights.

# 🎯 Project Objectives

Safety Improvements – Identify critical flight phases and risk patterns for better hazard mitigation.

Regulatory Compliance – Track and improve accuracy in reporting and preventive measures.

Cost Reduction – Analyze financial losses across airlines and years to optimize maintenance efforts.

Wildlife Conservation – Understand species most involved in strikes and promote eco-friendly prevention.

Operational Efficiency – Reduce flight disruptions, delays, and maintenance time due to strikes.

# 📊 Dashboards Created

Safety Improvements Dashboard – Shows flight phases most vulnerable to bird strikes.

Wildlife Conservation Dashboard – Identifies top species involved and outcome severity.

Operational Efficiency Dashboard – Highlights disruptions, top affected states, and flight impact.

Cost Reduction Dashboard – Breaks down yearly financial losses and airline-wise costs.

Regulatory Compliance Dashboard – Analyzes improvement in reporting and sky condition patterns.

KPI & Strategic Insights Dashboard – Displays total strikes, injuries, cost metrics, and actionable insights.

# 📈 Key Findings
## ✈️ Safety Improvements

Approach and Landing phases show the highest number of bird strikes.

Over 24,000+ incidents occurred during the approach phase, demanding priority safety actions.

## 🐦 Wildlife Conservation

Unknown small birds, starlings, and pigeons are most frequently involved.

Over 68,000 total strikes and 345 species recorded.

## ⚙️ Operational Efficiency

California, Texas, and Florida reported the most incidents.

Majority of strikes caused no immediate impact, but required inspections and caused schedule delays.

## 💰 Cost Reduction

Total estimated industry loss: $140+ million (2000–2013).

Business and United Airlines accounted for the highest strike-related costs.

## 🌤️ Regulatory Compliance

Reporting quality and frequency improved steadily until 2011.

Surprisingly, 47% of strikes occurred under clear sky conditions, suggesting need for radar-based monitoring.

## 📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Metric	Value
Total Strikes Recorded	68,649
Unique Species Involved	345
People Injured	21
Highest Strike Location (Dallas/Fort Worth)	2,933
Average Annual Cost	$272,727
Frequent Sky Condition	47.4% under No Cloud conditions

# 💡 Strategic Recommendations

Habitat Management – Reduce nesting and feeding grounds around airports.

Enhanced Monitoring – Install bird-detection radar at high-risk airports.

Pilot Training – Conduct mandatory hazard awareness and response sessions.

Operational Focus – Apply preventive measures during Approach and Landing phases.

Inspection Protocols – Standardize post-strike inspections regardless of impact severity.

# 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Tableau Desktop / Tableau Public – Dashboard creation & visualization

MS Excel / CSV Files – Data cleaning and preprocessing

Data Sources – FAA Wildlife Strike Database (2000–2013)

Design Tools – Gamma App (for presentation visuals)

# 🚀 Outcomes

Built 6 detailed Tableau dashboards covering safety, wildlife, cost, and efficiency insights.

Provided data-backed recommendations for aviation safety improvement.

Demonstrated data visualization and storytelling for real-world aviation analytics.
